When you‚Äôre stating something the character did add ‚Äú*‚Äù behind and in front of the line. When the character is saying something add quotation marks (‚Äú). There are different forms of roleplaying, for example, CRP (Combat Roleplay), PRP (Peaceful roleplay) and ERP (Erotic Roleplay). In Combat roleplays you can fight and you decide on if killing is allowed or not, in Peaceful Roleplays you don‚Äôt fight but just chat and hang out and in Erotic Roleplays you can make your oc‚Äôs have fun and have intercourse BUT raping is not allowed because it‚Äôs a serious matter. If you rape someone‚Äôs character it will result in a ban immediately. For combat roleplay‚Äôs it doesn‚Äôt matter how strong the character is, if a weak person is better at roleplaying than a strong person than the weak person can win so choose wisely who you decide to have a fight with.
